🚀 Executive Summary

Enterprise-grade RPA solution that automates an end-to-end SAP GUI Sales Order & Material de-allocation process, replacing a repetitive daily manual task with a resilient, validated, and fault-tolerant automation.
The solution integrates Python business logic, SAP GUI scripting, validation checkpoints, retry mechanisms, and automated reporting, delivering ~50 business days saved per year and eliminating operational risk.

🎯 Business Problem

The de-allocation process was executed manually on a daily basis and suffered from:

High dependency on SAP session state

Repetitive and time-consuming execution

Risk of human error (wrong SOs or materials)

No validation of execution results

No visibility of time loss or efficiency impact

This generated inefficiency, rework, and risk in a productive SAP environment.

🧠 Solution Overview

A modular and resilient RPA architecture was designed to fully automate the process while separating business logic from SAP interaction.
Each critical step includes validation checkpoints, controlled retries, and error handling to ensure safe execution in SAP GUI.

🖼 RPA Orchestration Breakdown

High-level flow:

SAP session initialization and cleanup

Business logic preparation (Python)

Input file validation (SO & Material files)

SAP navigation with screen/state validation

De-allocation execution

Result validation (success / failure)

Controlled retry loop (if required)

Results extraction

Automated email notification

Safe SAP shutdown

📊 Results & Business Impact

~50 business days saved per year

100% elimination of manual execution

Zero dependency on human availability

Reduced operational risk in SAP

Traceable execution and auditability

🔍 Before vs After

Before

Manual daily execution

High error probability

No execution validation

No performance metrics

After

Fully automated process

Validated execution at each step

Automated reporting

Measurable efficiency gains

🧩 Key Features

🛠 Tech Stack

Python (business logic, validation, reporting)

SAP GUI Scripting

RPA Orchestrator (enterprise environment)

Excel (input/output files)

Email automation (status & results)

🧠 Challenges & Design Decisions

SAP instability → Solved with session cleanup and state validation

Risk of partial execution → Implemented checkpoints and retries

Tight coupling risk → Business logic fully decoupled from SAP layer

Production safety → Conservative navigation and validations
